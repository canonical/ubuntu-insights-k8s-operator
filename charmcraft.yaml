  A Juju charm for deploying and managing the Ubuntu Insights server components on Kubernetes.

  This charm include two main services. A web-exposed service used for accepting HTTP requests with insights report payloads from clients, as well as an ingest service for validating accepted reports, and inserting them into a PostgreSQL database.

  This charm is part of the Ubuntu Insights project, a transparent, user-friendly, open, platform-agnostic, and cross-application solution for reporting hardware information and other collected metrics.

# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository, we encourage responsible disclosure. Please report any security issues to help us keep `ubuntu-insights-server-k8s` secure for everyone.

This repository packs the server services of [`ubuntu-insights`](https://github.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-insights) into a [Juju Charm](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-insights-k8s-operator). For vulnerabilities specific to the Charm, please report them there.

### Private Vulnerability Reporting

The most straightforward way to report a security vulnerability is via [GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-insights-k8s-operator/security/advisories/new).
For detailed instructions, please review the [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) documentation.
This method enables you to communicate vulnerabilities directly and confidentially with the `ubuntu-insights-server-k8s` maintainers.

The project's admins will be notified of the issue and will work with you to determine whether the issue qualifies as a security issue and, if so, in which component.
We will then handle figuring out a fix, getting a CVE assigned and coordinating the release of the fix to the various Linux distributions.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us, and what we expect from you.
